This repo is a collection of dashboards created for the Runescape 3 PvM Leeches sellers community.

## A summary about the business

Runescape 3 is an MMORPG, meaning it's a big game with a lot of players that interact with one another. 
In this game you have multiple bosses that give you loot/special items if defeated. Lot's of people are willing to buy "boss kills"
This business provides that services, amongst a few others. We take one person and beat the boss for them, but ensure that they get loot sometimes.
There are also achievements to be earned and people pay for that as well.
